    <h1>Welcome to 4th Year Project Management System</h1>
    <p>If you don't have an account yet, please visit the registration form above.</p>
    <p>Before you start to register the fourth-year project, please make sure that the following prerequisites are
        satisfied.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Fourth-Year Engineering Status and ECOR4995 (may be taken concurrently), as well as completion of other
            course prerequisites particular to a project and set out by the project supervisor. Engineering year status
            is not the same as University Year Standing (See § 4.7). The full definition is found under the Academic
            Regulations and Requirements for the Bachelor of Engineering Degree.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If students do not meet the above prerequisites, they must obtain a wavier from the Undergraduate Academic
        Support Office of the Faculty of Engineering and Design, 2090 Minto Case Building.</p>
    <p>All students who are under the supervision of a Systems faculty member must register in the fall and winter terms
        of SYSC-4907 in Carleton Central. Students in Communications Engineering and Computer Systems Engineering can
        choose to do a project in Electronics, and if they are under the supervision of an Electronics faculty member
        must register in ELEC-4907 in Carleton Central. If you register in ELEC-4907, meaning that you are working on a
        project offered by the Department of Electronics, you don’t need to register on this website. In extremely rare
        cases, students may participate on projects outside both Systems and Electronics, for example iTAC offered by
        MAE. In these cases, once you are granted permission to undertake such a project, you also need to register on
        this website (using a particular project marked as “external” and in SYSC-4907). If in doubt about these rules,
        please contact the 4th year project administrator. In all cases, improper registration may lead to delays in
        graduation.</p>
    <p>The Department of Systems and Computer Engineering does not offer the project during the summer. All projects
        must be completed in the fall/winter timeframe.</p>
    <p>Note: Registration in the project precludes registration in any co-op work term. In other words, you cannot do
        your 4th-year project while you are on a co-op work term.</p>
